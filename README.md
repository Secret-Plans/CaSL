# CaSL
The official repository for CaSL (Calculator Scripting Language).

# About
CaSL is a scripting language designed to make programming for the calculator easier. It's aimed at CASIO calculators, specifically the FX series (fx-9750, fx-9860).

# How it Works
Once you've written a program with CaSL, the compiler can convert it into a .casb file. It does this in three main steps:
1. Lexical Analysis
2. Parsing
3. Compilation

Each step feeds into the next until a .casb file is outputted. The .casb file is the CASIO Basic equivalent of the .casl that was compiled.
